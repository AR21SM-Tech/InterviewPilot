# STAR Method for Behavioral Interviews

The STAR method is a structured approach to answering behavioral interview questions.

## What is STAR?

- **S**ituation: Set the scene and context
- **T**ask: Describe your responsibility
- **A**ction: Explain what you did specifically
- **R**esult: Share the outcomes and learnings

## Example Answer Structure

**Q: Tell me about a time you had to lead a team through a difficult project.**

**Situation**: "At my previous company, we were tasked with migrating our monolithic application to microservices within 3 months while maintaining 99.9% uptime."

**Task**: "As the tech lead, I was responsible for designing the migration strategy and coordinating a team of 6 engineers."

**Action**: "I implemented a strangler fig pattern, created a detailed rollout plan with feature flags, and set up daily standups to track blockers. When we hit a database bottleneck, I personally led a 48-hour optimization sprint."

**Result**: "We completed the migration 2 weeks early with zero customer-facing downtime. The new architecture reduced deployment time from 4 hours to 15 minutes."

## Pro Tips

1. **Be specific** - Use numbers, dates, and concrete details
2. **Focus on YOUR actions** - Use "I" not "we"
3. **Keep it concise** - 2-3 minutes per answer
4. **Practice out loud** - It should sound natural, not rehearsed
5. **Prepare 5-7 stories** - They can be adapted to multiple questions
